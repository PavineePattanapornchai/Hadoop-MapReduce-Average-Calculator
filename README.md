# Hadoop-MapReduce-Average-Calculator
This project demonstrates how to use Hadoop MapReduce and Python to calculate the average value from a dataset. It leverages Hadoop Streaming to run Python-based mapper and reducer scripts, allowing for distributed computation across a Hadoop cluster to efficiently process large datasets.
